#We can use the skfuzzy control system API to model this. First, letâ€™s define fuzzy variables
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz
from skfuzzy import control as ctrl

# New Antecedent/Consequent objects hold universe variables and membership
# functions
quality = ctrl.Antecedent(np.arange(0, 11, 1), 'quality')
service = ctrl.Antecedent(np.arange(0, 11, 1), 'service')
tip = ctrl.Consequent(np.arange(0, 26, 1), 'tip')

# Auto-membership function population is possible with .automf(3, 5, or 7)
quality.automf(3)
service.automf(3)

# Custom membership functions can be built interactively with a familiar,
# Pythonic API
tip['low'] = fuzz.trimf(tip.universe, [0, 0, 13])

# You can see how these look with .view()
quality.view()
service.view()
tip.view()


# In[3]:


#If the food is poor OR the service is poor, then the tip will be low
#If the service is average, then the tip will be medium
#If the food is good OR the service is good, then the tip will be high.

#Now that we have our rules defined, we can simply create a control system via:

tipping = ctrl.ControlSystemSimulation(tipping_ctrl)

# Note: if you like passing many inputs all at once, use .inputs(dict_of_data)

# Crunch the numbers
